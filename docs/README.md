# HiveGraph
Python Framework based on PyG for working with Representation Learning using Graph Neural Networks

Currently has implementations for :-

* Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN)
* Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
* Residual Gated Graph Convolutional Networks (ResGatedGCN)

Example Training Script
```
python train.py --config=hivegraph/configs/classification/gin.py
```
